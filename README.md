Ted Budd represents the 13th District of North Carolina. He is a member of the Republican Party and serves in the House of Representatives. He never held a public office prior to being elected.

Budd owns ProShots Indoor Range and Training, a gun shop and training facility. He believes coming into Congress with no prior political experience will allow him to bring fresh insights into politics. It will allow him to represent his constituents fairly. 

He sits on the House Financial Services Committee, where Budd recently fought to repeal the Durbin Amendment. The plan limited the amount banks could charge retailers for debit card fees. Budd opposed the amendment because it was causing banks to charge customers more fees elsewhere to make up for the retail limit placed on them. He thinks supporting banks over small businesses in this instance helps economies overall because strong banks are needed for a healthy economy. The GOP dropped their plans for repealing in May.

Budd also worked on passing the Financial Choice Act, which the House passed this month. The act gives banks the option of staying under Dodd-Frank or leaving it and retaining about 10 percent of their capital from investments in case of a financial crisis. Dodd-Frank, which Budd opposes, is a piece of legislation passed in 2009 to add further regulations on banks during the economic recession.

Budd joined a group of Congressmen in asking the International Trade Commission to protect jobs in North Carolina and side with ATM manufacturer Diebold-Nixdorf in a current patent infringement dispute with Japanese company Hyosung.


Budd sits on these subcommittees:

Housing and Insurance

Terrorism and Illicit Finance

Capital Markets, Securities and Investments

He supports President Trumpâ€™s plan to build a wall along the Mexico border and is in favor of repealing the Affordable Care Act.
